<u> Mathematics-Testing-Program summary </u>

This program was my final submission for my NEA A Level project, and recieved a grade A*.

My program has the following purposes:
* To provide a virtual quiz environment for a student to revise A Level Maths
* To learn from the students previous answers to quiz questions, identify student weaknesses and display more personalised questions each time the student takes a quiz
* To provide an environment for the teacher to be able to view student results from quizes recorded by this program

<u> How to run the program </u>

To run the program, fork this reposity and clone it locally.
Then run the _Mathematics Testing Program.sln_ file using Microsoft Visual Studio.
The user should then be presented with a login / create account page.
Create an account as either a student or a teacher.

<u> Student user type </u>

As a student, you will be presented with a quiz containing 5 questions.
You can cycle between these questions and input your response to each one.
After you have finished answering the quesitons you wish to attempt, click end quiz and you will be presented with a score.
You will then have the option to view the markscheme for these questions.

<u> Teacher user type </u>

As a teacher, you will first be presented with the option to create a new classroom (optional).
You can cycle between the different modes of grade analysis using the navigation bar at the top of the page.

One option you have as a teacher is to view the progress of a student in a specific topic.
You can do this by selecting a student, choosing a module you wish to check their progress on, and then selecting a topic within that module.

You can also view the progress of the different classes over time.
